        <p><b>William Henry Gates III </b>(born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman, investor, philanthropist,
            and writer
            best known for co-founding the software giant Microsoft, along with his childhood friend Paul Allen. During
            his
            career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and
            chief
            software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a prominent
            pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

        <p>Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New
            Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in
            January
            2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief
            software
            architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered
            anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned
            into a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private
            charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of
            the Microsoft board in February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed
            CEO
            Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on
            his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.</p>

        <p>Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's billionaires. From 1995 to 2017, he
            held
            the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except in 2008 and from 2010 to 2013. In
            October
            2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion
            compared
            to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. In the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023,
            he was ranked 6th with a wealth of $115.0 billion. As of January 2024, Gates has an estimated net worth of
            US$140 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires
            Index.</p>

        <p>Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued other
            business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN,
            Cascade Investment, TerraPower, bgC3, and Breakthrough Energy. He has donated sizable amounts of money to
            various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates
            Foundation,
            reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century
            vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa. In
            2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give
            at
            least half of their wealth to philanthropy.</p>
